Learn about asynchronous callback functions by taking example of long-execution time function on /start page. Without callbacks, the entire website will wait (i.e. you cannot access /upload page) until the execution of the long execution-time command is complete. This is due to the execution model of Nodejs that has a single process. The async callbacks make creation of an event loop possible. Line 6 of requestHandlers.js is an example of an asynchronous callback function.
