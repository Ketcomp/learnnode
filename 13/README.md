####Node.js web-app that:
 * Welcomes user with instructions
 * Accepts user information like gender, age-group and accent
 * Displays a sentence for the user to record and uploads it to the server.
 * Refreshes the sentence without refreshing the screen so that the user can keep recording.

#####What it doesn't do so far:
 * Quit option.
 * Redo option.
 * Session ID that is recorded.
 * Thank You page at the end - that would end the session and make the session uniquely identifiable on the database
